# Hash Evidence

Compute cryptographic hashes for a file or a whole tree, and write a manifest that can
be checked later by anyone, with or without this plugin.

## When to use

- Baselining an item at the moment of acquisition.
- Producing a manifest for a batch before packaging or handover.
- Adding a second algorithm to items already recorded under SHA-256 alone.

Hashing alone establishes integrity, not custody. Pair it with log-custody.

## Inputs

- Path to a file or directory. Required.
- `--blake3` — also compute BLAKE3. Optional.
- `--out <path>` — manifest destination. Defaults to `manifests/<name>-<date>.sha256`.

## Procedure

### 1. Pick the hashing binary

macOS has no `sha256sum`. Resolve once, then reuse:

```bash
if command -v shasum >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  SHA256="shasum -a 256"
elif command -v sha256sum >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  SHA256="sha256sum"
else
  echo "no SHA-256 tool available" >&2
fi
```

Both write `<hash>  <path>`, so a manifest from one is checkable by the other.

### 2. Hash a single file

```bash
shasum -a 256 "$TARGET"
```

Report the digest in full. Never abbreviate a hash that is the point of the operation.

### 3. Hash a directory

```bash
find "$TARGET" -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -0 shasum -a 256 > "$MANIFEST"
```

`sort -z` matters: without it the manifest order depends on filesystem traversal and
two runs over identical content produce different files. Sorted output diffs cleanly.

For BLAKE3, repeat with `b3sum` and write a sibling `.blake3` manifest. Do not
interleave algorithms in one file — checkers expect one algorithm per manifest.

### 4. Record scale

```bash
wc -l < "$MANIFEST"     # entries
du -sh "$TARGET"        # total size
```

Warn before starting if the tree is large enough that hashing will take minutes.

### 5. Report

State the digest or the manifest path, the entry count, and the total size. If any file
could not be read, name it — a manifest with silent gaps is worse than no manifest.

## Output

- For a file: digests printed, nothing written.
- For a directory: a manifest at the resolved path, plus a `.blake3` sibling if asked.

## Notes

- This skill only produces hashes. Checking them is verify-bundle's job.
- Manifest paths are relative to the directory that was hashed, so the manifest stays
  valid if the tree is moved as a unit.
- A hash proves the bytes have not changed since it was taken. It says nothing about
  where the bytes came from or whether they were authentic when acquired.
